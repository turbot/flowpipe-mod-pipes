# Pipes Mod for Flowpipe

Pipes pipeline library for [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io), enabling seamless integration of Pipes services into your workflows.

## Documentation

- **[Pipelines â†’](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/pipes/pipelines)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Docker daemon must be installed and running. Please see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more information.

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-pipes.git
cd flowpipe-mod-pipes
```

### Credentials

By default, the following environment variables will be used for authentication:

- `PIPES_TOKEN`

You can also create `credential` resources in configuration files:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/pipes.fpc
```

```hcl
credential "pipes" "my_pipes" {
  token = "tpt_cld630jSCGU4yre79890csdjch79"
}
```

For more information on credentials in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Credentials](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/credentials).

### Usage

List pipelines:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline list
```

Run a pipeline:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run get_user --arg user_handle='turbot'
```

You can pass in pipeline arguments as well:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run get_organization_member --arg user_handle='turbot' --arg org_handle='turbot'
```

To use a specific `credential`, specify the `cred` pipeline argument:

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run get_user --arg user_handle='turbot' --arg cred=my_pipes
```

For more examples on how you can run pipelines, please see [Run Pipelines](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/pipelines).

### Configuration
